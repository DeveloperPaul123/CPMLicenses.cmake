# CPMLicenses.cmake

A license collector for your projects using CPM.cmake.

## About

Many open-source projects require adding a disclaimer to your binary reproducing the dependencies license. Unfortunately, finding and maintaining the disclaimers for all dependencies can be a tedious task. Luckily, if you're using [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/TheLartians/CPM.cmake) to add the dependencies, this process can be automated using this package.

CPMlicenses.cmake will automatically scan all source directories of your CPM.cmake dependencies and find any file that begins with `LICENCE` or `LICENSE`, appending the contents to an output file that you can use as a license disclaimer. If no license has been found for a package, a warning will be emitted. 

## Usage

Use [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/TheLartians/CPM.cmake) to add CPMLicenses.cmake to your project.

```cmake
CPMAddPackage(
  NAME CPMLicenses.cmake 
  GITHUB_REPOSITORY TheLartians/CPMLicenses.cmake
  VERSION 0.0.4
)
```

After all additional dependencies have been added, create the target by calling `cpm_licenses_create_disclaimer_target(<target name> <output file> <packages>)`. Afterwards, simply build the CMake target with the specified name to create the file containing the licenses.

For example, with the configuration

```cmake
cpm_licenses_create_disclaimer_target(
  write-licenses "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/third_party.txt" "${CPM_PACKAGES}"
)
```

building the target `write licenses` (e.g. calling `cmake --build build --target write-licenses`) will create the file `third_party.txt` in your build directory, containing all license disclaimers of dependencies added by CPM.cmake.

## Example output

The generated disclaimer contains the name of the dependency as well as the included license text. Below is an example of the disclaimer generated for [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).
